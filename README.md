# ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will need a modern web browser and a code editor like VS Code.

1. Clone the Repository
First, get a copy of the project on your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/manasaa4/Aarogya-Saathi-App.git
cd Aarogya-Saathi-App

2. Set Up Your Firebase Project
This application requires a Firebase backend to function.

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add a Web App to your project to get your firebaseConfig keys.

Enable Firestore Database: Create a new Firestore database and start it in Test Mode.

Enable Authentication:

Go to the Authentication section.

Under the "Sign-in method" tab, enable the Google provider.

Under the "Settings" tab, add 127.0.0.1 to the list of Authorized domains.

Copy your firebaseConfig object into the <script> tag at the bottom of the index.html file, replacing the placeholder values.

3. Run the Application
Because this project uses JavaScript modules, it must be served by a web server to avoid CORS errors. The easiest way to do this is with the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Install the Live Server extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" (or click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner).

The application will open in your default browser, and you can start using it by signing in with your Google account.
